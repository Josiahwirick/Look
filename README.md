# Look - A game made in Godot

*A small game project built in Godot Engine as a creative and technical exercise.*

## About the Game

Look is a low poly spot-the-difference game (think "I'm On Observation Duty") created as part of my journey to improve my technical ability and code practices. It features simple controls, short play sessions, and some replayability.

This project is currently being open sourced to share my development process, showcase my work, and gradually replace non-redistributable assets with original, open ones.

**Not included (for now):**
- 3D models, textures, and some UI elements (due to license restrictions)
